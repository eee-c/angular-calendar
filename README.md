# Funky, Angular Calendar

A simple [Angular.dart](https://github.com/angular/angular.dart) (*Dart*) calendar application, mostly used for exploring.

To install:

0. Get [Dart](http://dartlang.org).
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `pub get` to get dependencies.
3. Start the server with `pub serve`.

The application will be at: http://localhost:8080/index.html.

The “Basics” application demoing ng-model will be at: http://localhost:8080/basic.html.

## More Information

This code was created while exploring Angular.dart in my [blog series](http://japhr.blogspot.com/search/label/angular).

The approach is similar to a [Backbone.js calendar](https://github.com/eee-c/Funky-Backbone.js-Calendar) that I wrote to support [Recipes with Backbone](http://recipeswithbackbone.com).
